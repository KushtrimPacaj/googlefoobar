 * Being a henchman isn't all drudgery. Occasionally, when Commander Lambda is feeling generous,
 * she'll hand out Lucky LAMBs (Lambda's All-purpose Money Bucks). Henchmen can use Lucky LAMBs to
 * buy things like a second pair of socks, a pillow for their bunks, or even a third daily meal!
 * <p>
 * However, actually passing out LAMBs isn't easy. Each henchman squad has a strict seniority ranking
 * which must be respected - or else the henchmen will revolt and you'll all get demoted back to minions again!
 * <p>
 * There are 4 key rules which you must follow in order to avoid a revolt:
 * 1. The most junior henchman (with the least seniority) gets exactly 1 LAMB.
 * (There will always be at least 1 henchman on a team.)
 * 2. A henchman will revolt if the person who ranks immediately above them gets more than double the number of LAMBs they do.
 * 3. A henchman will revolt if the amount of LAMBs given to their next two subordinates combined is more than the
 * number of LAMBs they get.  (Note that the two most junior henchmen won't have two subordinates, so this rule doesn't apply to them.
 * The 2nd most junior henchman would require at least as many LAMBs as the most junior henchman.)
 * 4. You can always find more henchmen to pay - the Commander has plenty of employees.
 * If there are enough LAMBs left over such that another henchman could be added as the most senior while obeying the other rules,
 * you must always add and pay that henchman.
 * <p>
 * Note that you may not be able to hand out all the LAMBs.
 * A single LAMB cannot be subdivided. That is, all henchmen must get a positive integer number of LAMBs.
 * <p>
 * Write a function called answer(total_lambs), where total_lambs is the integer number of LAMBs in the handout you are trying to divide.
 * It should return an integer which represents the difference between the minimum and maximum number of henchmen who can share the LAMBs
 * (that is, being as generous as possible to those you pay and as stingy as possible, respectively)
 * while still obeying all of the above rules to avoid a revolt.  For instance, if you had 10 LAMBs and were as generous as possible,
 * you could only pay 3 henchmen (1, 2, and 4 LAMBs, in order of ascending seniority), whereas if you were as stingy as possible,
 * you could pay 4 henchmen (1, 1, 2, and 3 LAMBs). Therefore, answer(10) should return 4-3 = 1.
 * <p>
 * To keep things interesting, Commander Lambda varies the sizes of the Lucky LAMB payouts: you can expect total_lambs to always be between 10 and 1 billion (10 ^ 9).
 * <p>
 * Test cases
 * ==========
 * <p>
 * Inputs:
 * (int) total_lambs = 10
 * Output:
 * (int) 1
 * <p>
 * Inputs:
 * (int) total_lambs = 143
 * Output:
 * (int) 3
